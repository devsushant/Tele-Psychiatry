        <h2>Mental Health and Well-being</h2>
        <p>Mental health is an essential part of our overall well-being. It includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. Good mental health helps us cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and contribute to our communities. It also enhances our relationships, making us more resilient and able to deal with challenges.</p>

        <h2>Why Mental Health Matters</h2>
        <p>When we talk about mental health, we are talking about more than just mental illness. Mental health is about having a sense of well-being, being able to function effectively in daily life, and feeling emotionally stable. It is about finding balance in our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Mental Health Awareness</h2>
        <p>It is important to raise awareness about mental health and well-being. Many people still feel ashamed or embarrassed to talk about their mental health issues. By raising awareness, we can reduce the stigma surrounding mental illness and create a more supportive environment for those who are struggling.</p>
